[BETA] GetEmBernie.exe

Hi everyone,

I’m looking for beta testers for this designed specifically for Don't Starve Together. The program helps identify and track griefers by analyzing screenshots for Steam profiles and comparing them against a list of known or potential griefers.

What the Program Does:
Function: The program detects Steam profiles and character icons in screenshots and then checks these profiles against lists of griefers.

Detection Methods:
Multiple Players: When SOLO_TARGETING is set to FALSE, the program will take a screenshot 2 seconds after you start the analysis. If no icons are detected, it will return to the options menu.
Single Player: When SOLO_TARGETING is set to TRUE, the program will take a screenshot 3 seconds after you start the analysis and require you to hover over the icon before clicking. If it doesn’t detect the icon, it will wait 10 seconds before returning to the options menu.

Instructions:
Info Folder: Contains detailed instructions on how to use the program.
banlist.txt: A list of known griefers.
warnlist.txt: A list of possible griefers. If you find any people with a 'warning', please try to gather evidence
Ensure that all Steam IDs added manually to lists end with a '/' to be recognized correctly.

Feedback:
Private Feedback: Please contact me directly on u/Leowanaton .
Suggestions: Feel free to leave comments here.
Thank you for helping with the beta testing!
