Hi everyone,

We're working on a project designed to help identify and track griefers in Don't Starve Together. The program analyzes screenshots for Steam profiles and compares them against a list of possible griefers. We're currently in the beta testing phase and looking for players to help test and improve the tool.

If you're interested in helping us make the DST community a safer place, we'd love to have you on board! Your feedback will be invaluable in refining the tool and making it more effective.

If you want to help by recording griefers, follow my guide (i strongly advice to make videos and not screenshots): https://telegra.ph/Reporting-Guide-09-07

Requirements:
This program needs Java 18 (18.0.2.1) or higher to work
Minimum: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html
Latest: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRgLuNWCq6c

What the Program Does:
Function: The program detects Steam profiles and character icons in screenshots and then checks these profiles to see if they match with steam profiles contained in warnlist.txt.
IMPORTANT: Do NOT assume players in warnlist.txt are all griefers, especially if profile has no current reports, however pay attention and be ready to record if they do grief.

Detection Methods:
Multiple Players: When SOLO_TARGETING is set to FALSE, the program will take a screenshot 2 seconds after you start the analysis. If no icons are detected, it will return to the options menu.
Single Player: When SOLO_TARGETING is set to TRUE, the program will take a screenshot 3 seconds after you start the analysis and require you to hover over the icon of player to check. If it doesnâ€™t detect the icon, it will wait 10 seconds before returning to the options menu.

Instructions:
Info Folder: Contains detailed instructions on how to use the program.
warnlist.txt: A list of possible griefers. If you detect anyone with a 'warning', try to monitor them, never kick someone if they dont have a reports OR report page unless they grief on you. Making new reports is always welcome even if the player already has some. Always check the current report page of a warned player (if any) to be up to date and see when the last report was made to make better assertion (you can share with others the page if u want, ur not the only one voting to kick anyway).
If someone does not have any report page OR no reports in report page, you should never kick them (because there is nothing to support the grief claim) but still try to remain vigilant.
graylist.txt : A list of people you analyzed in the past
Adding manually steamids to warnlist.txt is not suggested, though possible (it just wont correspond with the official one).
You can always download the official version of warnlist.txt from the application itself or manually from the official GitHub repository https://github.com/Yocxhell/GEB/

Feedback: Please contact me directly on Reddit (u/Leowanaton), Steam (Yocxhell) or Discord (_yocxhell) .
Suggestions: Feel free to leave comments on Github.
Thank you for helping!
